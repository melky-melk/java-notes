# java-notes

ahahaaa im just a uni student who likes to overcomment on code so i can learn the language.
here are my noties, enjoy! :D

also note: the files in folders should read together, concepts like abstraction and subclasses should be read with the files next to each other because it makes more sense in context with other stuff and whatnot
