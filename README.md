# java-notes

ahahaaa im just a uni student who likes to overcomment on code so i can learn the language.
here are my noties, enjoy! :D

note: this shit isnt in the order it should be read, idk how to make it not alphabetical 

another note: the files in folders should read together, concepts like abstraction and subclasses should be read with the files next to each other because it makes more sense in context with each other and whatnot

another nother note: this just assumes python knowledge at times.
